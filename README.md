For International Womens Day, I chose to participate in a women-empowering initiative that derived itself from the successful tech precedent, AI-for-India, that holds the prestigious Guinness World Record(GWR), which I had participated in and received my own Record Particpant Certificate in from GWR.

AI-for-Women is aiming to upskill more than 10,000 women globally online with the tech skills associated with Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
